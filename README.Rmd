## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to access the unprocessed data of 
[RATO vzw](https://oost-vlaanderen.be/wonen-en-leven/natuur-en-milieu/overlastsoorten/rattenbestrijding-.html) 
via an API call to an [ESRI ArcGIS instance](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/).
Credentials are required to access this data. These credentials are stored as a github secrets under the `RATO_USER` and `RATO_PWD` environmental parameters, and can be set locally by editing the `.Renviron` file.

## Set Up your RATO credentials locally

The easiest way to store the required username and password necessary to access the RATO database is by storing them in your `.Renviron` file. An easy way to edit this file is by using a function from [the usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/). 

```r
install.packages("usethis")
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

The contents of the file may contain other secrets or settings used by other scripts or packages, but can be edited to have lines like:

```
RATO_USER = "RATO_INBO"
RATO_PWD = "a super fake password that should be replaced by your real one"
```

After restarting your R instance you should be able to fetch data from the RATO database without being prompted for your credentials.


## Installation

You can install the development version of ratatouille from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("inbo/ratatouille")
```

## Example

Once you have your credentials stored, getting raw data from RATO is as easy as:

```{r example of main function}
library(ratatouille)
rato_data <- ratatouille()
dplyr::slice_sample(rato_data, n = 5) |>
  dplyr::select(dplyr::all_of(c("Soort", "Materiaal_Vast", "Materiaal_Consumptie", "Laatst_Bewerkt_Datum")))
```
For this example a subset of fields that should not contain sensitive information were selected.

## Species in the dataset
This is raw data, some cleaning will be required. Dutch names and GBIF taxon ids are provided, but these last are often unchecked and may contain errors.

```{r}
dplyr::count(rato_data, Soort, sort = TRUE)
```
